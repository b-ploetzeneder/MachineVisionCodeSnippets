## Inputs


| Name                                        | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Image | U8 image containing exactly 1 binary particle. |
| Speedup|  Constant that makes the algorithm faster, and more unprecise (we just scale the input image..) |

**Warning:** Ensure that the image contains only 1 binary particle. Make sure that the image is large enough to contain the center of the circle.

## How to use it

You can find an example program here:  https://github.com/b-ploetzeneder/MachineVisionCodeSnippets/blob/master/examples/Particle_Enclosing_Circle.vi

## How does it work?

There are plenty of algorithms for this problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem

I chose one that is easy to understand, although it is not the fastest.

The implementation is based on 3 ideas:
- The center of the circle is somewhere in the image (this has to be ensured by the user)
- The only points that can define the circle lie on the Convex Hull
- The center of the circle lies on the watershed lines of the Convex Hull (this is not so self-evident, but you can read the paper here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4567872/ 

I brute-force the search of the minimal circle by
- calculating each possible center (based on IMAQ Watershed)
- testing each center by calculating the maximal distance to each point on the convex hull contour (this is the radius of a enclosing circle going through that center)
- selecting the center point that produces the smalles radius
