API-Overview over the current functions.
## Requirements

This API is based on LabVIEW 2017 / Vision 2018.

[^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ "/docs/structure/" | relative_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.

**ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo.
